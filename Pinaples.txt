Pinaples are My favorate appart from Apples here n Uganda
Reason why is that they are the only fruits with the natural tast that you wil find on the maret actually
I don't like comparisons but when I compare pinaples from Congo Which are nature by the way(meaning camicals have not bee used to grow them),I don't really find a difference, So having same tast,i like pinaples here as much as I would do in Congo
